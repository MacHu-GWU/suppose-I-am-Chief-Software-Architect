Product Manager
==============================================================================

As a product manager, I want to figure out:

1. Why users want to try Spotify?
2. Why users want to keep subscribing Spotify?
3. Why users want to choose Spotify over other App?


Basic Feature
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Must-to-have features. If we don't have these, users will leave.

1. Spotify has the song they want to listen.
2. They can easily find and play their favorite songs anytime, anywhere.
3. It is easy to find new songs to listen.
4. Download songs offline to play.


Unique Feature
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

User would so love these features, and only we have, but our opponent don't, which makes us stands out.

1. Super high quality playlist made by Spotify.
2. We provide the best music recommendation engine, based on one song, one artist, one album, one playlist, user's favorite, user's recent listening activity.
3. It is easy to stream to phone, PC, TV, Carplay, sound bar.


Bonus Feature
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is nice to have, maybe very important to some users, but not necessary.

1. Nest playlist, manage playlist like a file browser.
2. Podcasts.
