Product Manager
==============================================================================

As a product manager, I want to figure out:

1. Why .gov institution want to use login.gov?
2. Why users want to use login.gov?
3. Why users keep using login.gov?
4. Why users want to choose login.gov over other App?

As I can see, login.gov has two group of users, .gov institution, and individual users. We call .gov institution, Service Provider.


Basic Feature
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Must-to-have features. If we don't have these, users will leave.

1. Secure login solution with MFA.
2. Easy and secure integration with Service Provider.


Unique Feature
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

User would so love these features, and only we have, but our opponent don't, which makes us stands out.

1. Secure login workflow to protect users from been fished / losing login.
2. Indirectly access / verify individual's identity by doc auth, biometrics auth. Service provider loves this.


Bonus Feature
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is nice to have, maybe very important to some users, but not necessary.

1. Consistent user experience on PC and Mobile.
2. Many options for MFA method.
